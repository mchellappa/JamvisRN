# Jamvis Android - Manual Build Guide

Due to SSL certificate issues in your network environment, automated build tools are blocked. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Android Studio (Most Reliable)

1. **Install Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install with Android SDK and emulator

2. **Create New Project**
   - File > New > New Project
   - Choose "Phone and Tablet" template
   - Select API level 21+ (Android 5.0+)

3. **Copy Your Code**
   - Copy `/screens`, `/components`, `/services` folders to the new project
   - Copy `App.js` content to `App.tsx` or `App.js` in the new project
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack axios react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
     ```

4. **Build APK**
   - Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
   - Find APK in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

## Option 2: Expo Web Dashboard

1. Go to https://expo.dev/
2. Create an account
3. Create new project
4. Upload your code files
5. Use their cloud build service

## Option 3: Development Testing (No APK needed)

```bash
# Try tunnel mode (might work better with SSL issues)
npx expo start --tunnel

# Or try offline mode for local testing
npx expo start --offline
```

Then install Expo Go app on your Android device and scan the QR code.

## Your Project Status

✅ All screens created (Login, Workouts, Meals, Grocery List)
✅ Navigation setup complete
✅ API service layer ready
✅ Backend integration configured
✅ All dependencies defined

The app is ready - you just need to build it using one of the above methods!

## Quick Test

To test your screens work, try running:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

This will open your app in a web browser for immediate testing.
