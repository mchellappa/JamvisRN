# Pragmatic Android Compatibility Strategy

## 📊 **Android Market Reality (2025):**
- **API 19 (Android 4.4)**: ~0.1% of devices worldwide
- **API 21 (Android 5.0)**: ~2% of devices worldwide  
- **API 24 (Android 7.0)**: ~15% of devices worldwide

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach:**

### Option A: **Increase minSdkVersion to 21**
```gradle
// android/build.gradle
ext {
    minSdkVersion = 21  // Instead of 19
    // ... rest unchanged
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No manifest overrides needed
- ✅ No rabbit hole of library discoveries
- ✅ Reliable, supported configuration
- ✅ Still covers 98%+ of Android devices

**Cons:**
- ❌ Excludes ~0.1% of very old devices

### Option B: **Keep API 19 with Nuclear Override** ☢️
```xml
<uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary="*" />
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Covers maximum device range
- ✅ No more library hunting
- ✅ Builds will succeed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **May crash on API 19 devices**
- ⚠️ **No safety net for unsupported APIs**
- ⚠️ **Unpredictable runtime behavior**

## 🛡️ **If You Keep API 19:**

1. **Extensive Testing Required** on real Android 4.4 devices
2. **Graceful Degradation** for unsupported features
3. **Crash Reporting** to monitor real-world issues
4. **Fallback Web Version** for problematic devices

## 💡 **My Honest Recommendation:**

**Use API 21 (Android 5.0)** as minSdkVersion. The 0.1% of users on Android 4.4 in 2025 likely have devices too old/slow to run your app smoothly anyway.
