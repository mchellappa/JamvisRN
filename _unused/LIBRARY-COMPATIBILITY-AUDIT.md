# Comprehensive Android API 19 Library Compatibility Audit

## 📋 **Current Dependencies Analysis**

### **Runtime Dependencies:**

#### 1. **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^2.2.0**
- ❌ **POTENTIAL ISSUE**: AsyncStorage 2.x likely requires API 21+
- 🔍 **Need to check**: Official minSdkVersion requirements
- 💡 **Alternative**: May need to downgrade to 1.x version

#### 2. **react@18.2.0** 
- ✅ **COMPATIBLE**: Pure JavaScript, no Android SDK dependencies

#### 3. **react-dom@^18.2.0**
- ✅ **COMPATIBLE**: Web-only dependency, no Android impact

#### 4. **react-native@0.73.6**
- ❌ **CONFIRMED ISSUE**: Requires API 21+ (we have override in place)
- 🔧 **Status**: Manifest override applied

#### 5. **react-native-web@^0.21.0**
- ✅ **COMPATIBLE**: Web-only dependency, no Android impact

### **Development Dependencies Analysis:**
All dev dependencies (Babel, Webpack, etc.) are build-time only and don't affect runtime Android compatibility.

## 🚨 **Critical Issue Identified: AsyncStorage**

The @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0 likely requires API 21+. This is a MAJOR issue because:
1. It's used extensively in BackwardCompatibleJamvisApp.js
2. It's essential for offline data storage
3. Version 2.x probably dropped API 19 support

## 🔍 **Investigation Required:**
1. Check AsyncStorage official minSdkVersion
2. Test if current version works with API 19 override
3. Consider downgrade if necessary

## ⚠️ **Other Potential React Native 0.73.6 Sub-dependencies:**
React Native 0.73.6 may include other libraries requiring API 21+:
- Hermes engine
- JSC (JavaScriptCore)
- New Architecture components
- Various Facebook libraries

## 🎯 **Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate**: Check AsyncStorage compatibility
2. **Test**: Verify current overrides handle all sub-dependencies
3. **Fallback**: Consider React Native 0.68.x (last version with broader API 19 support)
